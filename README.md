# Comparing Open-source LLMs and Human Annotators in Disease Mention Recognition

This repository includes the implementation and analysis of a text mining project made to understand whether open-source LLMs can produce high-quality Disease Mention annotations, following the same annotation guidelines used by human annotators. The project investigates the impact of various prompt engineering techniques on the performance of the Disease Mention Recognition task.
