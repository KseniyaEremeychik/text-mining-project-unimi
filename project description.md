### Disease Mention Recognition using open-source LLMs

> Instructor: Darya Shlyk, *Department of Computer Science, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano*

Disease Mention Recognition (DMR) is a key task in biomedical NLP, focusing on identifying disease mentions from unstructured text. For example, in the sentence "The patient was diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension" the terms "diabetes" and "hypertension" should be labeled as disease mentions.

Manual disease annotation is a complex and time-consuming process that relies on expert knowledge and strict annotation guidelines, such as those used in the NCBI and BC5CDR datasets. 

This project aims to determine whether open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively perform the DMR task using prompt engineering (without instruction-tuning), and achieve annotation accuracy comparable to that of human experts.

#### Dataset

The available datasets are [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/), [BC5CDR](https://github.com/JHnlp/BioCreative-V-CDR-Corpus).
