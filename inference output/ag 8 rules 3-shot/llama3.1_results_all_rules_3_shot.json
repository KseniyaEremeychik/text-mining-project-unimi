Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the activation of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, leading to inflammation and villous atrophy in the small intestine when gluten is consumed. This results in malabsorption of nutrients, anemia, and other complications. Conversely, NCGS does not involve an autoimmune response or intestinal damage, but still produces gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain. In animals, NCGS has been observed in dogs, resulting in similar gastrointestinal distress, but it does not exhibit the same autoimmune pathology as seen in human NCGS. While patients with celiac disease require a strict gluten-free diet to prevent complications, individuals with NCGS often benefit from a gluten-reduced diet without the need for complete avoidance.",
